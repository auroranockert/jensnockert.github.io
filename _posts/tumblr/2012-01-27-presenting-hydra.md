I just want to present [Hydra](https://github.com/JensNockert/hydra), a small library I developed to enable applications to have a unified interface to the WebCL prototypes, even before the specification is ready.

I hope that within a year or so, that it will be useless, but for now it is pretty nifty. And allows me to use the same example code for Windows, Linux and OS X in my  "Tools for the next generation of Web Applications" series.

In addition to providing a unified interface, it also fixes some small bugs in the different prototypes.

It is available on Github [https://github.com/JensNockert/hydra](https://github.com/JensNockert/hydra) under the Simplified BSD license, you're essentially allowed to use it for whatever you want.

If you find any bugs or have a feature request; add an issue on Github or send me a tweet (@jensnockert).
